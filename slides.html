## Fostering Diversity in Open Source Communities: Introducing a Code of Conduct

## Trigger Warning: Harassment
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a Code of Conduct?

* A Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expected behaviours and responsibilities for participating within a community.
* It also serves to establish specific community guidelines.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Code of Conduct?

* Define community standards.
* Signal a welcoming and inclusive project.
* Providing a reporting mechanism for inappropriate behavior.
* Establishing procedures for handling harassment.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Diversity in Open Source Communities

In a 2017 survey, it was reported

* Gender
    * 3% of all respondents were women
* Ethnicity
    * 16% of them were ethnic minorities
* Other underrepresented groups
    * LGBT+, disabled people, etc.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Open Source Software

People matter as much as code!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Who can ask for inclusion of a CoC?

* Project maintainers
* Contributors
* Potential contributors
* External observers

*Basically anyone!*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Story of adding a Code of Conduct to the OCaml community
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OCaml

OCaml is an ML-family functional programming language

*ML as in meta-language, not machine learning ;)*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OCaml

OCaml is an ML-family functional programming language
- Created in 1996 at INRIA, France
- Many users from academia and industry
- Growing community across the world

* *Self plug*: Come to our workshop tomorrow on "A taste of Functional Programming with OCaml" to know more about OCaml.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OCaml community CoC

### Attempt#1 (2017-2020)

* Discussions among maintainers and community leaders to introduce a CoC.
* Formed a team and drafted a CoC based on the Contributor Covenant.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OCaml community CoC

### Attempt#2 (2022)

* I took the initiative to drive this forward on behalf of the OCaml Software Foundation.
* Established a team to draft a CoC and serve as arbitrators for violation reports.
* Proposed the addition of a CoC to major communication channels and GitHub source repositories.
* Sought community feedback.
* Made amendments based on suggestions.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Forming a CoC enforcement team 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Duties of the CoC enforcement team

* Serve as an approachable point of contact for discussing issues and act as arbitrators for handling violation reports.
* Ensure the enforcement of actions in accordance with the CoC guidelines.
* The scope includes GitHub projects and communication channels such as mailing lists, Discord, Slack, Discourse, and private messages within the community context.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Candidates

An ideal candidate for the CoC enforcement team is someone who is:
* Willing to do this work
    * often this is unpaid, non-rewarding volunteer work
* Been part of the community and intend to do so for some more time
    * A mix of recent and long-time contributors
* Generally nice and inclusive in their behaviour
* Project maintainers (not a hard requirement)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Candidates

To avoid conflict of interests, we didn't include:

* Individuals with significant power, such as BDFL.
* Individuals occupying prominent hiring positions, including CXOs of companies engaged in the community.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### CoC Team by-laws

Self-imposed rules for forming a diverse, representative, and approachable committee:

* Achieve a balance in terms of gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc.
* Ensure representation of the community's diversity.
* Maintain a number of members roughly proportional to the community's size.
* Avoid an overrepresentation of individuals from the same organization to promote decentralization.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Text

Two ways to go about it
* Use am existing Code of Conduct text as a starting point
* Write one from scratch

*There are pros and cons to both*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Various stages of action for CoC violation reports

* Private conversation or warning
* Public conversation or warning
* Request an apology
* Short-term ban
* Long-term ban
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Proposing to add a CoC

* We went with the popular Contributor Covenant as base text
* Added a community specific FAQ section
* Request for feedback on discourse forum
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CoC Adoption

A Code of Conduct (CoC) can be implemented when a project is created, or it can also be added at a later stage.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CoC Adoption

* Community should be onboard with the idea.
* It's crucial to solicit community feedback before implementation.
* Engage with the community to facilitate discussions on sensitive matters and work towards a compromise.
* Legitimate concerns should result in adjustments to the text or processes.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Points of contention

*Debunking some commonly raised concerns about introducing a Code of Conduct*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #1

_Explicitly listing protected classes makes others feel excluded_

Why list protected classes?
* Underrepresented groups are more vulnerable to harassment
* Listing protected classes does not imply exclusion of in-group individuals.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #2

*There's no need for a CoC; everything is functioning smoothly*

- Everything is "seemingly" all right - we don't know for sure
- That's not a guarantee there won't be incidents in future
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #3

*A CoC is centered around diversity*

- It is established with data that disparity in diversity is a problem in tech in general and OSS in particular
- Underrepresented groups are more vulnerable to harassment
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #4

*Interactions outside community spaces might be scrutinized*

- Interactions outside community is generally **not** a concern
- Unless there are serious issues like hate messages, etc.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #5

*Some members may leave the community - it will be a loss for the community*

* People may also leave due to abuse/harassment - also a loss for the community
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #6

*Issues with text*

* Nearly impossible to come up with a text everyone is 100% happy with
* Text can evolve based on community's needs
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Point of contention #7

*CoC enforcement team members may misuse their power*

* All members of the community are held to the same standards
* Reports on a team member will be treated like any other report
* They will be excluded from the investigation

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Amendments

* Changed the text to Coq community's Code of Conduct
    * Derived from Django Code of Conduct
* Some minor changes to text
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Takeaways

* A CoC lists responsibilities and expected behaviour for participation in a community
* It signals a community's values to contributors and other communities
* Has means for reporting and taking action for harassment
* Aims to make the community more inclusive
